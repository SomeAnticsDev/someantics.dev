It's a busy week of announcements for the [Astro](https://astro.build/) static site generator, including the launch of their [v1.0 beta release](https://astro.build/blog/launch-week/)! Islands architecture advocate [Ben Holmes](https://twitter.com/bholmesdev) rejoins Some Antics to show off how v1.0 lets us launch sites quickly with new integrations, community-built templates, and more â€” as well as how we can use Astro to go *beyond* static site generation.
