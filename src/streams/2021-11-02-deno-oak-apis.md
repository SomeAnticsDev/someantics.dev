[Anthony Campolo](https://twitter.com/ajcwebdev) returns to the stream to demonstrate ðŸ¦• [Deno](https://deno.land/), an alternative to Node. We're going to take a crack at building a simple REST API with Deno and [oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/), and explore how new tools like these can improve our workflow.

Anthony Campolo is a developer advocate at [StepZen](https://stepzen.com) and a [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) Core Team member. In a past life, he was a music teacher. He's big on learning in public, and about sharing what he learns.
