The web platform is really, really strong, and we can build a lot with our core web technologies, without needing the help of frameworks. JavaScript educator [Chris Ferdinandi](https://twitter.com/ChrisFerdinandi) joins the stream to build a lightweight, accessible, [Monsters, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsters%2C_Inc.)-themed (naturally), [Minesweeper-inspired game](https://vanillajsacademy.com/projects/monster-game/) — using vanilla JavaScript!

Chris Ferdinandi helps people learn vanilla JavaScript, and believes there’s a simpler, more resilient way to make things for the web. His developer tips newsletter is read by thousands of developers each weekday.
