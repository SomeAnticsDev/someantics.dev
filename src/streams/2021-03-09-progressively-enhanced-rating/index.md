Progressive enhancement is an approach to web development where we use the most broadly supported tools to ensure a minimum viable experience for everyone, and then provide optional visual and interactive enhancements on top of that for supported experiences. Progressive enhancement places a strong emphasis on semantic markup and accessibility.

Join Ben as he tries to progressively enhance an HTML-and-CSS-only rating widget that provides interactivity, accessibility, hover states and more without a lick of JavaScript! Ohâ€¦ and there's a live feed of Tuna the Cat while he naps. Can't forget about that Tuna cam.
