Join us as we dive into [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) and [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/), two tools built by the [Builder.io](https://builder.io) team to enable devs to create performant, interactive sites. Qwik is a web framework that cuts down on what gets shipped to the client by opting for [server resumability over hydration](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/concepts/resumable), and Partytown lets you offload your heavyweight, but nonetheless noncritical, scripts such as analytics libraries into web workers. We'll be joined by [Miško Hevery](https://twitter.com/mhevery), who is the creator of Angular and Qwik and the Chief Technology Officer at Builder.io!
