Site audits are a powerful tool for identifying and communicating actionable ways to improve a website's accessibility. Join us on Some Antics as [Hidde de Vries](https://twitter.com/hdv) walks us through his tips, tricks, and tools for auditing a website's accessibility with the [WCAG Evaluation Methodology](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/)!
