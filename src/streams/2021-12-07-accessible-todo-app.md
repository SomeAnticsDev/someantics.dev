The todo app is perhaps the most familiar web application tutorial project out there. However, most tutorials only get you part of the way there! Join us on Some Antics as [Michael “Chantastic” Chan](https://twitter.com/chantastic) shows us how we can take our todo apps further and build them from the ground up with accessibility in mind.

Michael Chan is the host of [React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.com), and he's cultivating the [Lunch Dev](https://discord.gg/lunchdev) community on Discord. He's still on the hunt for the perfect reuben sandwich.
