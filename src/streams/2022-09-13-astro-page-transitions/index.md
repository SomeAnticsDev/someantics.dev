Google Chrome's new experimental [Shared Element Transition API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/shared-element-transitions-for-spas/) enables single-page applications to transition from page to page smoothly and seamlessly as the user navigates, much like a native application might. Our guest [Maxi Ferreira](https://twitter.com/charca) has put together a lovely [proof of concept of page transitions working in a multi-page application](https://twitter.com/charca/status/1561830946462384128). Join us as he shows us how it can be done with web platform APIs and a little help from [Astro](https://astro.build/)!
