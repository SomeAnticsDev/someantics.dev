[Eleventy Serverless](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/) introduces a new way to build Eleventy sites â€” by generating pages upon request, rather than all at once. Currently, it's only available in canary builds leading up to Eleventy's v1.0 release, but recently, [the first draft of the Eleventy Serverless docs went live](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1408073561198280706).

Join Ben and Eleventy creator [Zach Leatherman](https://twitter.com/zachleat) for a first look at the Eleventy Serverless docs and canary builds!
