There are few things more frustrating than bugsâ€¦ particularly when they sneak in and break something which was already working or something that's already been fixed before. The test-driven development philosophy and process can help us prevent those bugs.

[Adrianne Mallett](https://twitter.com/mennairda) is a full-stack software engineer, accessibility advocate, Taylor Swift enthusiast, and a strong proponent for test-driven development.
