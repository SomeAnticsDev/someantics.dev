Oftentimes, we learn about web accessibility serendipitously â€” we see an unfamiliar word, or we catch a glimpse of something deep in a rabbithole of blogposts. Join us on Some Antics, as Ben kicks off [a11y.surf](https://a11y.surf), an open source web accessibility encyclopedia built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), with the goal of surfacing accessibility concepts and resources in one convenient place!

The **a11y.surf** project is inspired by [Tatiana Mac's](https://tatianamac.com) own [Self-Defined](https://selfdefined.app) project. Go check it out and contribute any way you can!
