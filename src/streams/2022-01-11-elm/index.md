[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) is a functional language that compiles down to JavaScript, with [“a strong emphasis on simplicity and quality tooling.”](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) Join us on Some Antics as [Lindsay Wardell](https://twitter.com/lindsaykwardell) helps us build some pretty familiar web applications the Elm way!

Lindsay is a full-stack developer at [NoRedInk](https://www.noredink.com/) and a host of the [Views on Vue](https://viewsonvue.com/) podcast.
