The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem that incorporates ideas from Git and BitTorrent, and the web at large. Among other things, it can be used as a way to deploy a site to the decentralized web.

[Anthony Campolo](https://twitter.com/ajcwebdev), developer advocate at QuickNode, rejoins the stream â€” this time to show off decentralized web deployment with IPFS!
