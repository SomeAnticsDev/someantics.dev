Recently, Eleventy creator [Zach Leatherman](https://twitter.com/zachleat) unveiled [WebC](https://github.com/11ty/webc), a compiler for custom elements that brings a single-file component authoring experience, asset bundling, and more to web components. It's not Eleventy-exclusive, but [it does work really well with Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/)! Join us as [Evan Sheehan](https://twitter.com/darth_mall) shows us how to get started with WebC in an Eleventy project of our own!
