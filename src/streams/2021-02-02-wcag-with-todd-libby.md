The W3C's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) are the industry standard requirements for making digital content — websites, mobile apps, documents, and more — accessible to disabled users. Understanding how to read the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines can help a developer make better, more accessible sites.

Join Ben and guest [Todd Libby](https://twitter.com/toddlibby) as we go through applying WCAG 2.1's Success Criteria to our own projects, and talk about the [first public draft of WCAG 3.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/). Todd is a W3C member, WCAG contributor, accessibility advocate, and notorious lobster roll connoisseur.
