**So you've written a test.** But how do you know if your *tests* are any good? [Mutation testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing) lets us gauge the quality of our test suites by introducing random bugs into our applications and seeing how many of our tests fail as a result. Join us on Some Antics as [Adrianne Mallett](https://twitter.com/mennairda) rejoins the stream to show us how we can use [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) to put our own web applications through mutation testing.
