title: Accessible Routing in RedwoodJS with Anthony Campolo and Dom Saadi
---

Accessibile routing is a bit of a gotcha in single-page applications. You generally need to use a combination of live region screenreader announcements and focus management to simulate the same feedback users would receive from a hard page load. There's so much opportunity for our tooling to help us get things right.

Join Ben and guests [Anthony Campolo](https://twitter.com/ajcwebdev) and [Dom Saadi](https://twitter.com/desaadi307) from the [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) Core Team, as they demonstrate how accessible routing works in Redwood, and the trial and error it took to get there.
