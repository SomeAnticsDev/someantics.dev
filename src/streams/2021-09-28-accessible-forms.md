Forms are some of the most important parts of a websiteâ€¦ and also some of the most complex. Join us on Some Antics as accessibility engineer [Rachele DiTullio](https://twitter.com/racheleditullio) walks us through making forms accessible to all. We'll dive into screenreader experiences, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines requirements, inclusive error messaging, and more!
