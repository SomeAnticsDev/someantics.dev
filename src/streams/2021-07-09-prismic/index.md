[Prismic](https://prismic.io) is a headless, component-driven content management system built for the Jamstack. Join us on Some Antics as Prismic developer advocate Alex Trost shows us just how easy it is to bring flexible, component-based content from Prismic into a Next.js app using Prismic's Slice Machine.
