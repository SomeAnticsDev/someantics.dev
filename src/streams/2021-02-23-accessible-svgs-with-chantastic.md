You know what they say… an icon is worth a thousand words. However, scaling icons up to reusable icon libraries can pose some interesting logistical challenges. Join us on <i>Some Antics</i> as [Chantastic](https://twitter.com/chantastic) walks us through his journey towards building accessible SVG icons in React.
