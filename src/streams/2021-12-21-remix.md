[Remix](https://remix.run) is a new tool for building and deploying fullstack React applications with a keen appreciation for the web's foundations, built by the team behind [React Training](https://reacttraining.com) — and it was just made open source! Come join us on Some Antics as [Chance Strickland](https://twitter.com/chancethedev) shows us how we can build a project management app using Remix.
