How can automated tools improve our accessibility testing process? Join us on Some Antics as Lucia Cerchie shows us how tools such as [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) and [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) can make our jobs easier, and how we can start using these tools today.
