How can automated tools improve our accessibility testing process? Join us on Some Antics as Lucia Cerchie shows us how tools such as [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) and [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) can make our jobs easier, and how we can start using these tools today.

Lucia is a software engineer living in Arizona. She's curious and passionate about accessibility and always willing to learn more. When she's not coding, she's doing yoga and hanging out with her one year old.
