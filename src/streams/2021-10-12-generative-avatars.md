Join us as we go on a journey through generative art, CSS's new [Houdini APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Houdini), and more with generative artist [George Francis](https://twitter.com/georgedoescode)! We'll use these techniques to build out unique generative user avatars! It's going to be one heck of a time.

George Francis is a developer, writer, and generative artist with a passion for teaching the web about creative coding and a love for googly eyes.
