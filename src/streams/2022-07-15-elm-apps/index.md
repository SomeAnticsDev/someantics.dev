[Previously on Some Antics](/elm/), we delved into the syntax for [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), a functional programming language that compiles down to JavaScript, with friend of the show [Lindsay Wardell](https://twitter.com/lindsaykwardell) â€” but we weren't able to get to application development in time.
Join us as Lindsay returns to the stream for a sequel on building Elm apps!
