Hey, there! [Some Antics](https://twitch.tv/SomeAnticsDev) is a weekly stream, held every Tuesday from 12pm to 1pm Central Time. Each stream is a hands-on dive into frontend development, with a special focus on web accessibility and core web technologies. I'm always on the lookout for more people to bring onto Some Antics. If you're interested, please reach out at [ben@benmyers.dev](mailto:ben@benmyers.dev).

## Code of Conduct

I'm committed to fostering an inclusive community, and I hope you'll join me in that. Please check out the [Code of Conduct](/conduct/), and make sure you agree with it.

## Stream Logistics

Some Antics streams are 12:00pm to 1:00pm Central Time on Tuesdays. Owing to my schedule, I don't currently have much flexibility there.

Leading up to the stream, I'll send you a Zoom invite. I'll be on the call half an hour early to make sure I'm ready to go. Please be on at least 15 minutes early so we can warm up and resolve any technical difficulties.

While streaming, I prefer to share my screen. This minimizes latency and resolution concerns, reduces the amount of setup adjustment I do between streams, and ensures I can control for accessible font sizes and color palettes. For code-along streams, I can send you a [VS Code Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share) link or give you read/write access to a CodePen so that you can participate in writing code. If you have concerns, or feel you need to share your screen, please let me know and we can figure something out.

## Recordings

I maintain a [backlog of Some Antics streams on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZluKlEc91YzYor_ItAax4d2iXTXbFAFF), with the intent that someone who missed a stream could go back and still learn from them. These recordings go up after the closed captions are ready, which can take anywhere from a few days to a week depending on my availability.

I firmly believe that, as a guest, you should be able to request **at any time** that your stream recording not be made public on YouTube, regardless of the reason. This includes recordings that have already been made public. I can also update the metadata of the video, such as its title and description. Please don't hesitate to reach out.
